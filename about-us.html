        <h2>About us</h2>
        <h3>Core</h3>
        <p>Energy transition has become a global trend. Light-weight solutions enhance product performance, but also conserve energy while adapting new types at the same time.</p>
        <p>Hence, we have been dedicating in producing and optimizing metal hardware, accessories and spare parts with aluminum alloy for the environmental friendly purpose. It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.</p>

        <h3>Strategy</h3>
        <p>Product quality is the foundation and one of the factors that we value the most. To achieve this goal, each process has to be precise and organized. Therefore, we introduced “Lean Production” into our processes and workflows to improve operational efficiency, reduce errors and unnecessary costs.</p>
        <p>In addition, in order to support this system, we had developed various raw material channels to enhance supply chain resilience which allowed us to work fluently during COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
